# CHIP8dotNET-Graphics
A CHIP8 emulator written in C# with WPF graphical output

This was a proof of concept of a CHIP8 emulator written in C# with graphical output. Most of the actual CPU code was copied from the non-graphical version. The graphics code was written at like 3 in the morning. WPF is not at all the best choice for something like this, but I know it pretty well so it's what I used. Games do load and display, some, like breakout, are even (barely) playable. The code and project are extremely buggy though, and I will likely never touch this again. It was pretty fun to make though, and I invite you to mess around with the code if you want.
